# GloalAIHubPythonHomework

Salut from Datca/Mugla!

I know basics of C# but this is my first steps into Python. I should say it's painful but rewarding.

This Readme file is gonna serve as a place where I can write my post homework notes throughout this course.

I attended the first lesson a little bit late so I missed __(Quiz 1)__ 
So if you'll ever get the chance to consider me for __*"Top Learner"*__ keep that in mind

About __HW1__:
I read an article about the superiority of f-string and I am pretty convinced so I decided to stick with it rater than str.format.
